            Welcome to 'Brave an interactive novel'. The choices YOU make as the game progresses, can have dire consequenses further along in the story. </p>
        <p></p>
        For every choice you make, your character will develop skills and attributes to match said choice. For example, you might be forced to choose between a pen and a sword at one point. While some philosophers might argue the pen is the more powerful choice,
        the choice is certainly you'rs to make and the story will continue in accordance to your choice.
        </p>
        <p>
            I do recommend consistency in your choices for a richer and more logical character development as it will make the later stages of the game a lot more intressting.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can get through the story in a number of diffrent ways and unlock unique exiting skills by changing your approach, Enjoy! <!--so please do use the save function and try out some diffrent paths!-->
