                <div class="text-section">

                    <p>Jay woke up with a small twitch. She stayed perfectly still as she listened for what might have woken her up but there was nothing but the rhythmic breaths of the forty or fifty sleeping kids currently occupying the room. Making noise
                        in the barracks at this hour was dangerous. Last week one of the new kids had been talking in his sleep, so King and his minions dragged him over to the middle of the room, beat him and threatened to cut out his tongue if he interrupted
                        their sleep again., and that boy got lucky. King was one of the older boys at the orphanage. His actual name was Ralph but since he was the biggest kid around, his word was basically law. Hence the name. He always found new ways
                        to torture the younger orphans and his latest pet peeve was not getting enough sleep due to noise in The Hole. This didn't actually bother Jay. Sleep was hard enough to come by and she was a very light sleeper so in a way King
                        had made her life easier. Well. Life would be much better without him around but the sleep thing was nice.</p>
                    <p>Every morning at sunrise, they woke up to do chores for Madam Hitch. Sewing clothes to sell, cleaning around the orphanage, doing odd jobs around the city (usually the kind of things too disgusting or humiliating for anyone else to
                        do), stuff like that. Once Jay was sent to recover an engagement ring that a mortified couple had dropped in a sewer drain. She spent almost four hours wading through shit before she found it. And after they were done with their
                        daily work or chores, it was time to start their actual work. Matam Hitch ran the largest ring of thieves and pickpockets in the city and the orphanage was the perfect front. Her system was easy. Bring back at least three coppers
                        every night and you would get a hot meal and a place to sleep. Jay had lived at the orphanage her entire life and only had to sleep in dark alleys or gutters a handful of times. This was an achievement she was proud of. Her best
                        friend AJ, who was sleeping soundly a few feet to her right, usually failed to make the fee at least a few nights every month, and he was still considered to be one of the best pickpockets around. The other kids would never admit
                        that Jay was better than them. After all, she was a girl. And she was only ten. Yet there she was, again, fed and not sleeping outdoors.

                    </p>
                    <p>There it was. The noise that had woken her up. Two voices speaking in hushed tones outside the closed door. She froze for a moment. Could the guards have followed her back here? No... The guards were well organized and very cruel but
                        once you knew their patterns, they were quite predictable and not very smart. She had been careful enough, no guards had even seen her, no alarms had been raised and she had still waited several hours and taken a long detour around
                        the entire city before returning to the orphanage. Plus, if it was the guards they wouldn't be whispering. And she would be missing a hand by now. It was still totally quiet in the big hall, no chatter or candles lit, so she couldn't
                        have been asleep for more than two maybe three hours. Who could be up at this hour, risking the wrath of King? Madam Hitch had never come down here in Jay's entire life so probably not her... But who then? She couldn't make out
                        any words from where she was lying but it sounded like a man and a woman speaking in low voices as to not wake the kids up.<br>She had to make a decision.</p>

                    <p>Because she had arrived home so late from the nights' job, she had the fortune of sleeping right by the door. It was generally considered the worst spot in the room because any time anyone had to step out for a midnight piss, you would
                        most likely wake up from them walking over you. Or if you didn't, they might check your pockets for a head start on tomorrows buy-in for the blankets and dinner. Tonight however, it might be a blessing because sneaking over to
                        the door would only take a few seconds. She removed her blanket, careful not to make a sound, and slowly crawled towards the door. It was only a few feet away but fearing the wrath of King, she took her time. When she finally got
                        to the door she pressed her ear to it and as she had suspected, it was clearly a man speaking - with madam Hitch!</p>
                    <p>"Are you really sure? Many of the older boys would be much better suited."<br> Said Madam Hitch<br> "Do not tell me what I need. I know what I need and it's your job to provide it. So provide."<br> "Of course, of course. it's just...
                        I have plans for her and I..."<br> "Phillipa. "<br> The man interrupted.<br> "Plans change. You will give me what I'm asking for, this is not a discussion. Understood? "<br> "Yes. Yes of course. I will talk to her and you can come
                        pick her up by the end of the week."<br> "I will be back for her tomorrow. As for the payment... "<br> The voices were moving away and Jay couldn't make out any more words. She slid back to her blanket and crawled under it. Who
                        was that man.. and who was he picking up tomorrow? Slowly she dozed off into an uneasy sleep filled with dreams of unknown voices whispering secrets.</p>

                        were moving closer so she might overhear something even without moving over to the door. But the door was to thick to let through anything useful... Something about the woman doing her job, providing something? Was that Madam Hitch?
                        The voices moved further away again and she couldn't make out anything else. Jay put the voices out of her mind, she needed sleep and risking the wrath of King by sneaking over to the door to listen g to a conversation that had
                        nothing to do with her seemed like a terrible idea. She was a curious child but after living her whole life just a mistake away from a beating, caution won. Slowly she dozed off into an uneasy sleep filled with dreams of unknown
                        voices whispering secrets.

                <div class="text-section hidden" id="p1">
                    <p>Jay woke up again at sunrise. Of course, it was still almost pitch black in the big hall as there were no windows in The Hole, the kids called it The Hole for just that reason. Jay would have preferred something a little more creative
                        like "The Obsidian Cave". Madam hitch had taken her to a jewelry store once, disguised as mother and daughter shopping for Jay's birthday gift, but really to teach Jay about gemstones and which were worth stealing. The salesman
                        had shown them a bunch of rings ankle bracelets and necklaces but what really caught her eye was displayed in the window facing the street. A necklace with stones as dark as the night sky. They seemed to suck the light right out
                        of the air and were quite enchanting to an eight-year-old child. Obsidian, had the vendor told her. After that, she had dreamed of black gems for weeks and unofficially named her shared bedroom after it. But a hole seemed to be
                        the darkest thing a group of aspiring thieves could agree upon, so The Hole it was. She knew it was sunrise though. Because she always woke up at sunrise. If you missed breakfast or failed to get there before it ran out you would
                        go hungry all day. Unless you managed to steal something or had the good fortune of looking hungry enough for someone taking pity on you. So most of the kids, who had lived at the orphanage as long as Jay, naturally woke up in
                        time to get their share of dry bread and cheese. </p>
                    <p>"Hey, Jay!"<br> "AJ."
                        <br> AJ caught up with her just as she entered the dining room, it was the largest room in the center orphanage and they used this room for most day to day things like eating, planning the nights' groups of thieves, collective
                        punishment, personal punishment with a crowd, that kind of stuff. The room was large enough to fit at least a hundred people but right now there were only ten kids or so, seated scattered across the three long tables that covered
                        most of the room. A few sat together but most that were up this early were also smart enough to simply eat as fast as possible then stuff their pockets with bread before the masses of less experienced kids came thundering through
                        the large doors leading down to The Hole. Once that happened the food would be gone in minutes so balancing getting enough sleep and getting to eat was a delicate art that some, Jay and AJ among them, had perfected. So the room
                        was still quiet. At the far end of the room by the kitchen door sat Madam Hitch enjoying her usual breakfast feast of sausages, fresh fruits, and newly baked bread. She was a quite beautiful woman. Or at least had the look of someone
                        who had been beautiful but the world had made hard and unapproachable. Her raven black hair was always set in a tight bun and her sharp, thin eyebrows constantly set in a suspicious frown. Her eyes were dark and calculating, always
                        watching for reasons to slap one of the young thieves in her care over the knuckles with whatever she could find within arms reach. That was just for minor misbehaviors though, break one of her many rules and the punishment would
                        be much more severe. Madam Hitch had an odd look on her face this morning, thought Jay. She looked almost worried or anxious instead of cold and calculating. Jay was just about to mention that to AJ when a man stepped through the
                        kitchen door and sat down next to Madam Hitch. He was dressed in all black but unlike the obviously uncomfortable woman next to him, he was smiling and conversing effortlessly. He scanned the room whilst talking and for a second
                        met Jays stare, he winked with one kind, blue eye and turned his head back to Madam Hitch. Could this be the man from outside The Hole last night? She quietly started telling AJ about the mysterious voices outside of the door last
                        night as the room quickly filled up with hungry orphans and she lost sight of the man.



                    </p>
                    <p>"Jay... You know this isn't a real orphanage. We don't get picked up by anyone, there is no happy home waiting for us."<br> AJ said carefully. They had had this conversation before and he knew it was a sensitive topic for Jay.<br>                        "Yes, I know.. I think its more like he wants me to do a job or something."<br> Jay had had dreams all night about finally being taken away from the orphanage and spent all morning dreaming the same dreams. Maybe someone did notice
                        her last night, just not the guards.<br> "You? Ha! He mentioned you by name, did he? The famous "Grab anything adJaycent" is gonna work for the big boys now is she?"<br> "Oh, shut up!"<br> Jay turned away from him to hide her eyes
                        tearing up and went back to looking over the room. Now everyone in the room was seated and she could finally see the stranger again. She saw him hand over a letter to Madam Hitch whilst laughing comfortably. Madam Hitch clearly
                        did not think the letter was a laughing matter but he didn't seem to care. Jay wondered what was in that letter. <br> The fact that she was convinced that it said something about her made her feel</p>
