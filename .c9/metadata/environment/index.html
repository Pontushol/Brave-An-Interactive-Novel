Jay would have preferred something a little more creative like","                \"The Obsidian Cave\".

If you missed breakfast or failed to get there before it ran out you would go hungry all day. Unless you managed to steal","                something or had the good fortune of looking hungry enough for someone taking pity on you.

Once that happened the food would be gone in minutes so balancing getting enough sleep and getting to eat was a delicate art that some, Jay and AJ among them, had perfected. So the room was still quiet. At the far end","                of the room by the kitchen door sat Madam Hitch enjoying her usual breakfast feast of sausages, fresh fruits, and newly baked bread. She was a quite beautiful woman. Or at least had the look of someone who had been beautiful but the world","                had made hard and unapproachable.

He was","                dressed in all black but unlike the obviously uncomfortable woman next to him, he was smiling and conversing effortlessly.

Because she always woke up at sunrise. If you missed breakfast or failed to get there before it ran out you would","                        go hungry all day. Unless you managed to steal something or had the good fortune of looking hungry enough for someone taking pity on you. So most of the kids, who had lived at the orphanage as long as Jay, naturally woke up in","                        time to get their share of dry bread and cheese. </p>","                    <p>\"Hey, Jay!\"<br> \"AJ.\"","                        <br> AJ caught up with her just as she entered the dining room, it was the largest room in the center orphanage and they used this room for most day to day things like eating, planning the nights' groups of thieves, collective","                        punishment, personal punishment with a crowd, that kind of stuff. The room was large enough to fit at least a hundred people but right now there were only ten kids or so, seated scattered across the three long tables that covered","                        most of the room. A few sat together but most that were up this early were also smart enough to simply eat as fast as possible then stuff their pockets with bread before the masses of less experienced kids came thundering through","                        the large doors leading down to The Hole. Once that happened the food would be gone in minutes so balancing getting enough sleep and getting to eat was a delicate art that some, Jay and AJ among them, had perfected. So the room","                        was still quiet. At the far end of the room by the kitchen door sat Madam Hitch enjoying her usual breakfast feast of sausages, fresh fruits, and newly baked bread. She was a quite beautiful woman. Or at least had the look of someone","                        who had been beautiful but the world had made hard and unapproachable. Her raven black hair was always set in a tight bun and her sharp, thin eyebrows constantly set in a suspicious frown. Her eyes were dark and calculating, always","                        watching for reasons to slap one of the young thieves in her care over the knuckles with whatever she could find within arms reach. That was just for minor misbehaviors though, break one of her many rules and the punishment would","                        be much more severe. Madam Hitch had an odd look on her face this morning, thought Jay. She looked almost worried or anxious instead of cold and calculating. Jay was just about to mention that to AJ when a man stepped through the","                        kitchen door and sat down next to Madam Hitch. He was dressed in all black but unlike the obviously uncomfortable woman next to him, he was smiling and conversing effortlessly. He scanned the room whilst talking and for a second","                        met Jays stare, he winked with one kind, blue eye and turned his head back to Madam Hitch. Could this be the man from outside The Hole last night? She quietly started telling AJ about the mysterious voices outside of the door last","                        night as the room quickly filled up with hungry orphans and she lost sight of the man.","","","","                    </p>","                    <p>\"Jay... You know this isn't a real orphanage. We don't get picked up by anyone, there is no happy home waiting for us.\"<br> AJ said carefully. They had had this conversation before and he knew it was a sensitive topic for Jay.<br>                        \"Yes, I know.. I think its more like he wants me to do a job or something.\"<br> Jay had had dreams all night about finally being taken away from the orphanage and spent all morning dreaming the same dreams. Maybe someone did notice","                        her last night, just not the guards.<br> \"You? Ha! He mentioned you by name, did he? The famous \"Grab anything adJaycent\" is gonna work for the big boys now is she?\"<br> \"Oh, shut up!\"<br> Jay turned away from him to hide her eyes","                        tearing up and went back to looking over the room. Now everyone in the room was seated and she could finally see the stranger again. She saw him hand over a letter to Madam Hitch whilst laughing comfortably. Madam Hitch clearly","                        did not think the letter was a laughing matter but he didn't seem to care. Jay wondered what was in that letter. <br> The fact that she was convinced that it said something about her made her feel</p>","","                    <ul class=\"choice-display\"
