#Thief - An interactive novel -- README.md

https://pontushol.github.io/Thief-An-Interactive-Novel/

If you're like me, when you read a book you get lost in it. Your world disapears 
and you live in which ever world you're reading about. 
I've tried to take that to the next natural, technological level and actually let you play part in the story. 
You make most of the crucial choices in the game and the story proggresses accordingly and the main 
character develops attributes and skills accordingly aswell. 
There are multiple ways to get through the story so feel free to get creative. Enjoy!
(This is written for Code Institutes Interactive Frontend Development Module and is the progogue of a larger story to text the concept)

##UX
The Project is supposed to be easily followed through diffrent choices provided by buttons. 

##Features

###Feature 1 
Gil(JS Object) - Allows users to progress through the story by making choices for the 
			     character in the book and adding unique variables to the object
           
###Feature 2
D3.js Data dashboard - Allows users to easily see the stats and unique information 
				   following their progress through the game

##Future Features

###Feature 3
Night Mode - Allows users to change color scheme of the app for a better experience in dark lighting. 

###Feature 4
JS Local Storage - Allows users to continue thier game from where they left of last. 

###Feature 5 - Save/Load function will be added with 10 save slots so users can try diffrent strategies while not loosing 
	    their proggress. 
	    
	    
##Testing 

Tested on Laptop and Samsung s7.
So far the app is simply to follow.
You start the game and follow which ever choice you prefer and it leads the story on. 
This also adds stats to your character which later will be implemented as requirements for certain choices.

Its styled simple and simmilar on all devises to keep focus on reading. 

Intresstingly, on both devises used for testing the last choice-section in the app is bugging, sometimes. I cant seem to figure out just yet why it works when it works or not when it doesn't. Testing is in proggress.
