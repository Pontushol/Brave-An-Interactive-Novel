#Thief - An interactive novel -- README.md

https://pontushol.github.io/Thief-An-Interactive-Novel/

If you're like me, when you read a book you get lost in it. Your world disapears 
and you live in which ever world you're reading about. 
I've tried to take that to the next natural, technological level and actually let you play part in the story. 
You make most of the crucial choices in the game and the story proggresses accordingly and the main 
character develops attributes and skills accordingly aswell. 
There are multiple ways to get through the story so feel free to get creative. Enjoy!
(This is written for Code Institutes Interactive Frontend Development Module and is a 5 chapter 
pre-release of the full book)
